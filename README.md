## The data and the challenge

I have downloaded from http://tomslee.net/airbnb-data-collection-get-the-data all the data available for the european cities of Amsterdam, Barcelona, Berlin, Dublin, Edinburgh, Geneva, Lisbon, London, Lyon, Madrid, Paris, Rome, Turin, Venice, Vienna and Zurich.

The data has been unzipped and merged in a file that has been uploaded at https://s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/airbnbchallenge/abnb_listings.csv

The idea is to understand the evolution of the market over time, and what drives the price of the listings

The results are presented [here as a Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/simonsaysL/airbnb-project/blob/master/Airbnb%20project%20-%20Simone.ipynb)
